# Customer Churn Prediction (Machine Learning)

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company using supervised machine learning techniques.  
It was developed as part of postgraduate-level data science training and refined through iterative experimentation and model improvement.

---

## Problem Statement

Customer churn represents a significant challenge for telecommunications companies.  
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model capable of identifying customers who are likely to cancel their service, enabling proactive retention strategies and improved customer satisfaction.

## Project Evolution

This work was developed iteratively, reflecting a real-world machine learning workflow:

- Exploratory data analysis and baseline modelling  
- Data cleaning and feature engineering  
- Training and comparison of multiple machine learning models  
- Model evaluation using appropriate classification metrics  
- Interpretation of results from a business perspective  

This progression demonstrates both technical development and analytical reasoning.

## Machine Learning Models

The following models were implemented and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  

Models were assessed using classification metrics including:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score
