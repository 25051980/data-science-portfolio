# 📦 Olist E-commerce: Logistic Efficiency and Customer Satisfaction – Data Engineering MVP

This project was developed as part of my postgraduate studies in Data Science and Analytics. It is focused on solving real-world business problems using data engineering techniques, particularly in the context of e-commerce logistics and customer satisfaction. The study is based on Olist, one of Brazil’s leading e-commerce platforms.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

The goal of this MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is to investigate key operational challenges faced by Olist, including:

- 🚚 **Logistic efficiency**: How delivery times and geographical distances impact customer satisfaction.  
- 😊 **Customer satisfaction**: How review scores and feedback reflect the delivery experience.  
- 📦 **Product and seller performance**: Which categories or sellers have high return or complaint rates.

By exploring these questions, the project aims to offer insights for improving delivery processes, enhancing seller performance, and increasing customer satisfaction.

## 🔍 Questions Explored

1. What is the average delivery time for orders?  
2. Is there a correlation between shipping cost and delivery time?  
3. Which cities/states have the longest delivery delays?  
4. Where do the most affected buyers live?  
5. How do delivery times relate to customer reviews?  
6. Which products/categories have the highest return rates?  
7. Who are the top-performing and most problematic sellers?
