## 🎓 About Me

I hold a **postgraduate degree in Data Science and Analytics** from the Pontifical Catholic University, where I specialized in:

- ✅ Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
- ✅ Data Analytics & Business Intelligence  
- ✅ Data Engineering (ETL, Cloud, Pipelines)

Additionally, I completed the **EBAC Data Science Bootcamp**, a comprehensive program with hands-on experience using real-world datasets, business cases, and end-to-end machine learning solutions.

Currently, I’m pursuing a **Master’s in Cyber Security** at St Mary’s University, Twickenham, expanding my skills in digital security, ethical hacking, and AI in security contexts.
