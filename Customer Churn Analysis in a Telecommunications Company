# Customer Churn Analysis in a Telecommunications Company

This project focuses on analysing and predicting customer churn in the telecommunications sector using supervised machine learning techniques.  
The objective is to identify customers at risk of cancelling their service and to extract actionable insights that can support data-driven retention strategies.

The work was developed as part of postgraduate-level training in **Data Science and Analytics** and reflects a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow.

## Problem Context

Customer churn has a direct impact on revenue and long-term sustainability in the telecommunications industry.  
By predicting which customers are likely to leave, companies can intervene proactively through targeted offers, service improvements, or personalised engagement strategies.

The challenge addressed in this project is to build a reliable classification model that distinguishes between customers who are likely to churn and those who are not.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains customer-level information, including:

- Contract and subscription details  
- Tenure and service usage  
- Billing and payment attributes  
- Customer demographic indicators  

The target variable indicates whether a customer has churned.

## Methodology

The project followed a structured machine learning pipeline:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understanding feature distributions and relationships  
   - Identifying potential drivers of churn  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Feature scaling where appropriate  

3. **Model Development**  
   Multiple supervised learning models were trained and compared.

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   Performance was assessed using standard classification metrics and interpreted from a business perspective.

## Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  

Models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score

## Key Results & Insights

- Contract type, tenure, and monthly charges were among the most influential factors affecting churn  
- Ensemble-based models (Random Forest) achieved the strongest overall performance  
- Visualisations and descriptive statistics supported interpretability and business understanding  

The results demonstrate how predictive modelling can be used not only for classification accuracy, but also for generating insights relevant to decision-makers.
