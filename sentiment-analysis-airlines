# ✈️ Sentiment Analysis on Airline Tweets – Deep Learning Project

This project was developed as part of my postgraduate studies in Data Science and Analytics, focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning. The goal was to build a neural network model that classifies customer tweets about U.S. airlines into sentiment categories: **"Positive - Neutral"** or **"Negative"**.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Airline companies in the United States face strong competition, and social media has become a key space for customer feedback. This project aims to help airlines understand customer sentiment through Twitter data, identifying dissatisfaction patterns and providing insights for improving customer service and brand reputation.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – Deep learning framework
- **Pandas / NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Visualizations
- **Scikit-learn** – Preprocessing, train-test split, metrics
- **CountVectorizer / Tokenizer / Padding** – NLP preprocessing
- **Google Colab** – Development environment

## 🤖 ML Models Used

- Neural Network (using TensorFlow/Keras)
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest (baseline)

The neural network model was trained to classify tweet sentiment and compared to traditional machine learning models to evaluate performance.

## 📊 Summary of Results

- **Dataset**: 14,640 tweets (sample of 600 used due to computational limitations)
- **Target variable**: `airline_sentiment`
- **Classes**: "Positive/Neutral" vs. "Negative"
- The neural network achieved a reasonable performance and outperformed classical models in capturing subtle patterns in text sentiment.

## ▶️ How to Run the Notebook

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. The dataset is loaded directly from a URL:
   ```python
   url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/25051980/MVP1/main/Tweets.csv'
   df = pd.read_csv(url)
