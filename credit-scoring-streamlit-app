## ðŸš€ Highlights

- Streamlit app interface for user-friendly prediction
- Random Forest Classifier trained on real-world features
- Data preprocessing, EDA, and feature engineering included
- Reproducible Jupyter Notebooks and well-structured code
- Large model file hosted externally due to GitHub limitations

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Pickle
