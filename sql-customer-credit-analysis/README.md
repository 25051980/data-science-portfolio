# 🧮 SQL-Based Customer Behavior Analysis – Credit Usage Project

This project was developed as part of the EBAC Data Science course and focuses on using SQL to explore and analyze customer behavior patterns based on a simulated credit card dataset. The analysis aims to extract insights that support credit risk assessment and marketing strategy development.
