# 📊 Education Analytics Project

This project was developed as part of the EBAC Data Science course and focuses on analyzing education-related data from the World Bank to understand how socioeconomic factors affect educational outcomes globally.

## 🎯 Objective

To investigate the relationship between:
- Government spending on education
- Literacy rates
- School enrollment (primary, secondary, tertiary)
- Student-teacher ratio
- Education outcomes across countries

It aims to provide insights aligned with the **UN Sustainable Development Goal 4: Quality Education**.

## 🧰 Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. Data Collection from World Bank datasets
2. Cleaning and preprocessing (handling nulls, renaming, filtering)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visuals
4. Grouping by income level to compare countries
5. Correlation analysis between education spending and literacy/enrollment rates

## 📈 Insights

- Countries with higher investment in education tend to have higher literacy and enrollment rates.
- Student-teacher ratio shows strong negative correlation with education quality.
- The gap between low-income and high-income countries remains wide in educational outcomes.
